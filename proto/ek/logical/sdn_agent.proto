// Entity Kind: SDN Agent (EK_SDN_AGENT)
//
// An abstract software agent that RK_CONTROLS one or more entities
// in a model instance. It exists to indicate to a consumer of a model
// which elements can receive instructions from an SDN controller, and
// allows for extremly fine-grained indication of controllable elements
// (at the level of entity instances).
//
// One EK_SDN_AGENT may RK_CONTROLS one or more of a variety of model
// entities. One list of allowed entities is maintained in this
// repository's validation go library.
//
// An EK_NETWORK_NODE may RK_CONTAINS an EK_SDN_AGENT, though this
// is not required. If such a construct is present in a model instance,
// it may be possible to characterize control plane communications that
// traverse other entities in the model (e.g. control plane channels
// that are routed over/like data plane channels).
