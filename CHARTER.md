## Technical Charter (the "Charter") for Outernet Council Projects
** Outernet Council Foundation **

---

**Adopted July 1, 2024**

This charter (the "Charter") sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the open source projects hosted by the Outernet Council Foundation (the "Project").  All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, "Collaborators") must comply with the terms of this Charter. 

### 1. Scope of the Project

The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.

### 2. Technical Steering Committee

a. The Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC") will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. 

b. The TSC will consist of the Project Committers as set forth in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.

c. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.  Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. 

d. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file. Unless otherwise documented: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify ("commit") source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the TSC. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the TSC.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. A Committer by default is not a voting TSC member. An existing TSC voting member can nominate a Committer to be a TSC voting member, which will require approval from the majority of existing TSC voting members.

e. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.

f. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

g. Unless the TSC decides otherwise, committers will operate using the Lazy Consensus method. (NOTE:  https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lazy_Consensus)

h. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and the Outernet Council Foundation.

i. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file) and coordinating with the Outernet Council Foundation to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 8 of this Charter;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viii. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ix. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.

j. A TSC member may be voted to be removed from the TSC by a two-thirds vote of the entire TSC.

k. A TSC member may resign by submitting their resignation to the TSC [mailing list](mailto:maintainers@outernetcouncil.org).

### 3. TSC Voting

a. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

b. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

c. Except as provided in Section 2.j, 8.c. and 9.a, decisions by vote at a meeting requires a majority vote of those in attendance, provided a quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting requires a lazy consensus of all voting members of the TSC.

d. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Outernet Council Foundation for assistance in reaching a resolution.

e. The voting members and their terms are listed in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.

f. If a TSC member resigns, then an election may be held to fulfil the seat vacated.  TSC members who have resigned cease to be TSC voting members and are not eligible to cast a vote for seat vacancies.

### 4. Compliance with Policies 

a. The TSC may adopt a code of conduct ("CoC") for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Outernet Council Foundation.  

b. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, the Outernet Council Foundation will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of the Outernet Council Foundation, any such amendment is effective upon publication on the Outernet Council Foundation’s web site.

c. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Project community.

d. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the Outernet Council Foundation.

### 5. Community Assets

a. The Outernet Council Foundation will hold title to all trade or service marks used by the Project ("Project Trademarks"), whether based on common law or registered rights.  Project Trademarks will be transferred and assigned to Outernet Council Foundation to hold on behalf of the Project. Any use of any Project Trademarks by Collaborators in the Project will be in accordance with the license from Outernet Council Foundation and inure to the benefit of Outernet Council Foundation.  

b. The Project will, as permitted and in accordance with such license from the Outernet Council Foundation, develop and own all Project GitHub and social media accounts, and domain name registrations created by the Project community.

c. Under no circumstances will the Outernet Council Foundation be expected or required to undertake any action on behalf of the Project that is inconsistent with the tax-exempt status or purpose, as applicable, of the Outernet Council Foundation.
