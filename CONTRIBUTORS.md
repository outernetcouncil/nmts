# Project History

This project started as Project Minkowski a software defined networking project under Google's Project Loon. The Loon project focused on bringing Internet access to rural and remote areas. The project used high-altitude balloons in the stratosphere at an altitude of 18 km (11 mi) to 25 km (16 mi) to create an aerial wireless network with up to 1 Mbit/s speeds. Project Loon began as a research and development project by X (formerly Google X) in 2011, but later spun out into a separate company in July 2018. Project Loon shut down in 2021.

In 2022 this project was spun out from Google to Aalyria Technologies, Inc. where this project continued its development as the Northbound, Southbound and East-West APIs as part of the Spacetime network orchestration product -- the Spacetime APIs. 

In 2024, this project was spun out as a neutral independent project under the Outernet Council.
