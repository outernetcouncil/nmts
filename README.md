# Network Model for Temporospatial Systems (NMTS)

Inspired by Google's Multi-Abstraction-Layer Topology (MALT; see
[NSDI 2020 site](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/mogul)
for paper, slides, and recorded presentation), this collection of protobuf
definitions and supporting code aims to make feasible richer communications
network modeling of time-dynamic elements.

As in the MALT paper, this is an Entity-Relationship system where each
have "kinds" but only Entities have attributes.

The primary purpose of this data model is to support constructing a graph
of a network with its temporo-spatial dynamic aspects suitable for:
1. evaluating whether and how a requested service might be built atop the network, and
1. issuing instructions to selected elements necessary to enact the service.

In other words, this data model is in service of a Network Digital Twin
of the style depicted in [draft-irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch-04#section-6):
